# Machine-Learning-Logistic-Regression
This simple project is my first step on Machine Learning where I have learned how to implement Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

# Dataset
I have worked with the famous [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset from Kaggle which contains two different files, train.csv that contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, and test.csv that contains similar information but does not disclose Survived information for each passenger. And this dataset is considered as the studentâ€™s first step in machine learning.

# Project
What I did in this project, is using the analysis method for classification problems Logistic Regression to classify either the Titanic passengers are survival or deceased, and the model I have built has an accuracy of 77%.

# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible classes (binary classification problem). The real life example of classification example would be, to categorize the mail as spam or not spam, to categorize the tumor as malignant or benign.
